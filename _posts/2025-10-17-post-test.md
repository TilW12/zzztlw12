About: PCB board created using Maker Cam 

Milling WorkFlow:

Key notes:
.8mm Corn flat-end bit is used to remove the bulk of the material
The .2mm*30ºEngraving(Metal) engraving bit will be used to cut out the copper traces
The Makera Milling machine affixes the FR4 using clamps, rather than adhesive, so tabs are necessary to keep the PCB in place.
2D contour is used for edge cuts 
2D pocket is used for copper traces
2D drilling is used for drill holes  

PCB Toolpath Workflow on MakeraCAM
Open MakeraCAM on your desktop.
Select the “3-AXIS” option on the welcome screen.
Edit the “Stock” settings in the top right corner
For Material, select “PCB”
For Length(X), adjust the value to 127mm
For Width(Y), adjust the value to 101mm
For Height(Z), adjust the value to 1.7mm (thickness of FR4)
In the top toolbar, click the icon titled “import PCB” and individually insert all Gerber files into the workspace.
The imported gerbers will likely populate outside of the workspace, so select all 2D layers, hover over the “Adjust object” and “Transform” drop-down menu and select the  “Move” tool
When layers are dotted, that indicates that they are selected; when layers are solid, that indicates that they are unselected
Select the bottom left corner as the anchor point
Set both the X and Y location values to 6 mm, which positions the file in the bottom right corner of the workspace
Keeping all layers selected, hold the shift key and deselect the outer edge of the Edge_cuts
Toggle the visibility such that only the “F_Cu” and the “Edge_cuts” layer are visible 
In the top toolbar, hover over the “2D Path” drop-down menu and select the “2D Pocket” option
In the dialogue box, adjust the “End Depth” value to .05mm
Under “Tools,” click the “Add Tool” button, select “.8mm Corn tool” and click “Choose”
Click “Add Tool” again, select the “.2mm*30ºEngraving(Metal),“ and click “Choose”
Ensure that the material selected is “PCB”
Click “Calculate”; you should see a “2D Pocket” toolpath fall under the Path dropdown in the hierarchy
If you have drill files, untoggle the visibility for all “F_Cu” and “Edge_cuts” layers and toggle visibility for all drill files 
In the top toolbar, hover over the “2D Path” drop-down menu and select the “2D Drilling” option
In the dialogue box, adjust the “Drill Tip End Depth” value to 1.7mm
Under “Tools,” click the “Add Tool” button, select “.8mm Corn tool” and click “Choose”
Click “Calculate”; you should see a “2D Drilling” toolpath fall under the Path dropdown in the hierarchy
To design a toolpath for the edge cuts, untoggle the visibility for all drill files and toggle visibility for solely the “Edge_cuts” layer
Select the inner outline of the “Edge_cuts” layer
In the top toolbar, hover over the “2D Path” drop-down menu and select the “2D Contour” option (synonymous with a “Pocket” cut)
In the dialogue box, adjust the “End Depth” value to 1.7mm
Under “Tools,” click the “Add Tool” button, select “.8mm Corn tool” and click “Choose”
Under “Strategy,” select “Outside”
Under “Tabs,” select “Custom,” and click “Add”
Add appropriate tabs around the selected “Edge_cuts” layer (typically, 3 will be sufficient)
Tip: Ensure that these tabs are staggered and not directly across from one another
Click “Calculate”; you should see a “2D Contour” toolpath fall under the Path dropdown in the hierarchy
In the top toolbar, click the icon “Preview Toolpaths,” and select all toolpaths in the pop-up dialogue box
Click “Preview” and press the play button to view a simulation of the toolpaths 
In the top toolbar, click the “Export” button, ensure all toolpaths are selected, and click “Export”
Rename the .nc file to your last name, your first initial, and your project name, followed by “gcode”


PCB Milling on Carvera Controller
Open the Carvera Controller software on the desktop
In the top toolbar, click on the button with the status “N/A disconnected”
Select the appropriate COM port to connect the Carvera to the computer (if the COM port is already connected, leave it as is)
In the menu in the top right corner, click “Switch to display manual control interface” followed by the “Home” button 
Under “Tool Status and Control,” ensure that the probe is charged to at least 3.6V (this ensures the machine operates in the z-axis as intended)
In the bottom left corner, open the G-code from your files 
Before starting the mill, open the menu in the top right corner and click the “Switch to display file preview interface” to preview the toolpaths 
Click “Config and run,” and ensure that both the “auto vacuum” and “auto leveling” options are on.
Once all settings are verified, click “Run”
